![](./preview/preview-1.gif)

## Computer Vision Flower Classification with Resnet50, TensorFlow and Streamlit

The Flower Classification Model was trained using the ResNet50 Architecture and the Transfer Learning Deep Learning Technique, also with the Google Colab GPU and with over 8000 Flower Images. The U.I. was built with Streamlit. It can be test it with uploading a Picture.

## Run it Locally

Test it Locally by running the `app.py` file, built with `Streamlit` Remember first to train the model in the `flower_classification.ipynb` file and saved in the the `model` folder.
## App made with Streamlit

```sh
streamlit run app.py
```
